# Dart Logseq Tangler

My [Dart][dart] learning project. Load a [Logseq][logseq] Markdown file spiked
with [Yarner][yarner]-style directives and extract code files from them.

[dart]: https://dart.dev
[logseq]: https://logseq.com/
[yarner]: https://mlange-42.github.io/yarner/

Structure follows the `dart create` template for command line applications:

- entrypoint in `bin/`
- library code in `lib/`
- tests in `test/`

# Usage

Don't. Not yet, anyways. Everything is hard-coded while I figure this thing out.
